 #Factorial of a Number
 '''
 Factorial is a product of all numbers from 1 to that number say n. 
 It can also be defined as product of 1, 2, up to n.
 Factorial of a number n! = 1 * 2 * . . . . . * n

#Running a simple for loop over the dictionary object traverses the keys used in it.

#Once we are able to get the key, its associated value can be easily accessed either by
# using square brackets operator or with the get() method.

The items(), keys() and values() methods of dict class return the view objects dict_items, 
dict_keys and dict_values respectively. 
These objects are iterators, and hence we can run a for loop over them.
