'''Sequence is a collection data type. It is an ordered collection of items. 
Items in the sequence have a positional index starting with 0. It is conceptually 
similar to an array in C or C++. 
There are following three sequence data types defined in Python.'''

#String example

print (str[2:])      # Prints string starting from 3rd character
print (str * 2)      # Prints string two times
print (str + "TEST") # Prints concatenated string

#List
list = [ 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 ]

'''The main differences between lists and tuples are: Lists are enclosed in brackets ( [ ] ) and their elements and size can be changed
 .ie lists are mutable, while tuples are enclosed in parentheses ( ( ) ) and cannot be updated (immutable). 
Tuples can be thought of as read-only lists. For example âˆ’'''
