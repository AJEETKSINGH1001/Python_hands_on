Python has been an object-oriented language since the time it existed. Due to this, creating and using classes and objects are downright easy. This chapter helps you become an expert in using Python's object-oriented programming support.
If you do not have any previous experience with object-oriented (OO) programming, you may want to consult an introductory course on it or at least a tutorial of some sort so that you have a grasp of the basic concepts.
However, here is a small introduction of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to help you.


Class
A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object
of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods,
accessed via dot notation.

Object
An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a class Circle, for example,
is an instance of the class Circle. A unique instance of a data structure that is defined by its class.
An object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods.

Encapsulation
Data members of class are available for processing to functions defined within the class only.
Functions of class on the other hand are accessible from outside class context.
So object data is hidden from environment that is external to class. Class function (also called method)
encapsulates object data so that unwarranted access to it is prevented.

Inheritance
A software modelling approach of OOP enables extending capability of an existing
class to build new class instead of building from scratch. In OOP terminology, existing class is called base or parent class, while new class is called child or sub class.
Child class inherits data definitions and methods from parent class.
This facilitates reuse of features already available. Child class can add few more definitions or redefine a base class function.

Polymorphism
Polymorphism is a Greek word meaning having multiple forms.
 In OOP, polymorphism occurs when each sub class provides its own implementation of an abstract method in base class.
