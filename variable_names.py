'''A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number or any special character like $, (, * % etc.
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Python variable names are case-sensitive which means Name and NAME are two different variables in Python.
Python reserved keywords cannot be used naming the variable.'''

'''Camel case − First letter is a lowercase, but first letter of each subsequent word is in uppercase. For example: kmPerHour, pricePerLitre

Pascal case − First letter of each word is in uppercase. For example: KmPerHour, PricePerLitre

Snake case − Use single underscore (_) character to separate words. For example: km_per_hour, price_per_litre'''

'''Python doesn't have any formally defined constants, However you can indicate a variable to be treated as a constant
 by using all-caps names with underscores. For example, the name PI_VALUE indicates
 that you don't want the variable redefined or changed in any way.'''
